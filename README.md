# Before you judge
This is mostly a prototype-like project. It has some flaws. Few of them are caused by wrong decisions made at the beginning of this project. Some of them are simple to fix, other are architecture-level and concept-level based problems. But I'm learning from my mistakes. I know about this issues/bugs/mistakes and will address them in next projects because this one is going to be closed/archived in few months (or it is now - depends when you are reading this).

# Why
It started as a prototype when I was working with UWP for the first time. Prototype had just a desktop view and a browser. Later I had to do an engineering project. So I came with idea that I can expand this prototype to create a full-size solution.

# About
- Main purpose of this project is to bring desktop-like experience to IoT world.
- It uses Windows 10 IoT Core as a base (or a host) to work on.
- All data are stored in SQLite file. Because of that switching from one device running under this app to another or creating backup is very simple.
- User is limited by the build-in sub-apps like browser, calculator etc. It's because main target of this project are seniors and kids.
