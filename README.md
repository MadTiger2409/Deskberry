# Before you judge
This is mostly a prototype-like project. It has some flaws. Few of them are caused by wrong decisions made at the beginning of this project. Some of them are simple to fix, other are architecture-level and concept-level based problems. But I'm learning from my mistakes. I know about this issues/bugs/mistakes and will address them in next projects because this one is going to be closed/archived in few months (or it is now - depends when you are reading this).
